\maketitle 

This is a checklist based on the lecture and textbook materials. It is not
expected to be an all encompassing study guide and provides a guideline for
your studies.

\begin{itemize}
  \setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item Chemical equations
\item Mole ratios - converting from one compounds to another
\item Meaning of mole ratios
\item Limiting reagent problems
\item Theoretical yield and percent yield
\item Molarity (mols/L)
\item Dilution problems ($M_1V_1 = M_2V_2$)
\item Molarity of ions
\item Stoichiometry with molarity
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Chapter 6: Thermochemistry}

\begin{itemize}
  \setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item Kinetic energy vs potential energy
\item Sign conventions (+/-)
\item Internal energy - work and heat
\item State function
\item Endothermic, exothermic reactions and effects of catalysts
\item Calculating heat ($q=mc\Delta T$) and thermal equilibrium
\item Calorimetry calculations
\item Standard enthalpy and enthalpy of reaction
  \item Hess' Law
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Chapter 7: Gases}

\begin{itemize}
  \setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item Boyle's Law

\textbf{Chapter 4: Chemical reactions and aqueous solutions}

\begin{itemize}
  \setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item What does the chemical equation tells you? Analogy to a cookbook
\item How to write a chemical equation? What is needed?
\item Meaning of coefficients in the chemical equation; what is the
  unit?
\item Balancing chemical equations - tips for balancing combustion
  reactions
\item Recognize and determine the different types of chemical reactions:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Combination (synthesis)
  \item Decomposition
  \item Single-replacement
  \item Double-replacement (two types)
  \item Oxidation-reduction (redox)
  \end{itemize}
\item Understand difference between electrolytes and nonelectrolytes
\item What and how many ions are formed from each ionic compound?
\item \textbf{Memorize the solubility rules} - extremely helpful for
  determining the precipitation reaction
\item Complete ionic and net ionic equations
\item Determining the spectator ions
\item Predicting products of combustion and acid/base reactions
\item \textbf{Memorize oxidation states} and how to determine them
\end{itemize}
